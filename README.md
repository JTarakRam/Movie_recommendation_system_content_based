## Recommendation System 
A recommendation system is a sort of information filtering system that seeks to forecast user preferences or interests and deliver individualised suggestions for products, services, music, movies, or news articles.

## Content-based recommendation
Content-based recommendation systems examine the properties or features of objects and propose related goods based on those attributes or features. A content-based system, for example, will propose additional songs or artists with comparable qualities, such as pace, key, or voice style, if a user enjoys a specific genre of music.

Collaborative filtering recommendation
Collaborative filtering recommendation systems, on the other hand, examine previous user behaviour or preferences and propose goods that comparable users have enjoyed or scored highly. Collaborative filtering is further classified into two types:

Collaborative filtering based on user preferences : This approach recommends things based on the preferences of users who are similar to the target user. For example, if user A and B share similar musical interests, and user A like a certain song, the algorithm will recommend it to user B.

Item-based collaborative filtering: This strategy suggests products that are comparable to those that the user has previously liked or rated highly. For example, if a user loves a specific song, the algorithm would suggest additional songs with similar features or those are often listened to by other users who also like the initial song.
